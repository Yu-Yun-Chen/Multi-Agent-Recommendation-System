You are solving a RECOMMENDATION planning task.

Input task fields (Yelp):
-type: is's fixed as "recommendation"
- user_id: appears in user and review
- candidate_list: a list of item_id; each appears in item and review
- candidate_category: high-level category of candidate items
- loc: (latitude, longitude)

Relevant datasets (Yelp):

user dataset — one row per user:
- user_id: unique user identifier; links to review.user_id
- name: user nickname
- review_count: total number of reviews this user has written
- yelping_since: when the user joined Yelp
- useful / funny / cool: votes received for their reviews
- elite: elite years string or None
- friends: list of friend user_ids or None
- fans: number of fans
- average_stars: user's average rating across reviews
- compliment_hot / more / profile / cute / list / note / plain / cool /
  funny / writer / photos: compliment counters indicating engagement level
- source: fixed as 'yelp'

item dataset — one row per business:
- item_id: unique POI identifier; links to review.item_id
- name: business name
- address: street address
- city / state / postal_code: business location metadata
- latitude / longitude: coordinates for distance matching
- stars: average rating for business
- review_count: number of reviews for business
- is_open: 1 = open, 0 = closed
- attributes: key-value dict of business properties
    (e.g., Alcohol, HasTV, Ambience, NoiseLevel, WiFi, etc.)
- categories: comma-separated high-level tags (e.g., "Restaurants, Barbeque")
- hours: daily opening times dictionary
- source: fixed as 'yelp'
- type: object type, usually "business"

review dataset — one row per review:
- review_id: unique review identifier
- user_id: reviewer (matches user.user_id)
- item_id: reviewed business (matches item.item_id)
- stars: star rating (1-5)
- useful / funny / cool: votes on the review
- text: free-text content of user's review
- date: timestamp of review
- source: fixed as 'yelp'
- type: object type, usually "business review"

Your goal:
1. Generate subgoals that retrieve necessary information from 
   user, item, and review.
2. Ensure subgoals enable a reasoning module to later rank 
   the candidate_list from most relevant to least relevant for the user.
3. Keep subgoals high-level, concise, and logically ordered.
4. For each subgoal, output "description", "reasoning instruction", and "tool instruction".

- started_at: reading start time (may be empty)
- n_votes: number of likes/upvotes the review received
- n_comments: number of comments on the review

1. Generate subgoals that retrieve necessary information from 
   user, item, and review datasets.
2. Ensure subgoals enable a reasoning module to later rank

4. For each subgoal, output "description", "reasoning instruction", and "tool instruction".

- Inside { }, use valid Python dict syntax:

- Do NOT use any braces { } or quotes " inside the values; keep them as plain text.
